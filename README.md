# BipOps

Spend more tip Bip'n and less time managing your game servers.

## Overview

BipOps provides a standardized Docker-based environment for running various game servers. It's designed to simplify the deployment and management of game servers, with built-in support for:

- Windows games (via Wine)
- Automated backups
- Game updates via SteamCMD
- Service management via s6-overlay

## Supported Games

Currently, BipOps supports the following games:

- **Palworld** - [quickstart here](./gameservers/palworld/README.md)
- **Sons of the Forest** - [quickstart here](./gameservers/sonsoftheforest/README.md)
- **Subsistence** - [quickstart here](./gameservers/subsistence/README.md)

Each game has its own configuration and management scripts.

## Getting Started

### Using Pre-built Images

You can use the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull justmiles/bipops
```

### Building from Source

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t bipops .
   ```

### Basic Usage

2. Run a game server container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     -e BIPOPS_GAMESERVER=palworld \
     -p 8211:8211/udp \
     -p 8212:8212/tcp \
     -p 25575:25575/tcp \
     -v /path/to/backups:/backups \
     -v /path/to/game:/game \
     --name bipops-palworld \
     justmiles/bipops
   ```

### Environment Variables

- `BIPOPS_GAMESERVER`: (Required) The game server to run (e.g., "palworld", "subsistence", "sonsoftheforest")
- `STEAM_USER`: (Optional) Steam username for non-anonymous downloads
- `STEAM_PASSWORD`: (Optional) Steam password
- `BIPOPS_VALIDATE_SERVER_FILES`: (Optional) Set to "true" to validate game files at launch
- `BIPOPS_BACKUP_INTERVAL`: (Optional) Backup interval in seconds (default: 3600)
- `BIPOPS_XSERVER`: (Optional) X server type for games requiring display (default: "xvfb")

## Game Server Configuration

Each game server is configured via a `.bip-ops.yaml` file in its respective directory under `gameservers/`. The configuration includes:

```yaml
game: Game Name # Display name of the game
usewine: true/false # Whether the game requires Wine
usex: true/false # Whether the game requires X11 display
steamid: 123456 # Steam App ID for the game
backupdir: /path/to/backup # Directory to backup for this game
configs: # Configuration file mappings
  "config/file.ini": "/game/path/to/file.ini"
```

## Adding New Game Servers

To add support for a new game server:

1. Create a new directory under `gameservers/` with the game's name
2. Create a `.bip-ops.yaml` file with the game's configuration
3. Create the necessary scripts:
   - `start.sh`: Script to start the game server

## Ports

The ports used depend on the game server being run:

### Palworld

- **8211/udp**: Game connection port
- **8212/tcp**: REST API port
- **25575/tcp**: RCON port

### Sons of the Forest

- **8766/udp**: Game connection port
- **9700/udp**: Blob sync port
- **27016/udp**: Steam query port

### Subsistence

- **7777/udp**: Game server port
- **27015/udp**: Steam query port

### Common

- **7756/tcp**: Xpra web access port (if enabled)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start:**

- Ensure `BIPOPS_GAMESERVER` is set to a supported game (palworld, subsistence, sonsoftheforest)
- Check that required ports are not already in use
- Verify volume mounts are properly configured

**Game files not updating:**

- Set `BIPOPS_VALIDATE_SERVER_FILES=true` to force validation
- Provide Steam credentials if the game requires authentication

**X11 display issues:**

- For games requiring X11 (usex: true), ensure `BIPOPS_XSERVER` is set appropriately
- Check that the Xpra service is running if using xpra mode

**Backup issues:**

- Verify backup directory has proper permissions
- Check `BIPOPS_BACKUP_INTERVAL` setting (default: 3600 seconds)

## ROADMAP

### Completed âœ…

- âœ… Include `BIPOPS_XSERVER` environment variable with options `xpra`, or `xvfb` (default `xvfb`)
- âœ… Set backup interval as environment variable (`BIPOPS_BACKUP_INTERVAL`)
- âœ… Add `bipops` user and limit root usage
- âœ… Add Palworld support

### In Progress ðŸš§

- ðŸš§ Add CI/CD pipeline
- ðŸš§ Add additional Steam games
- ðŸš§ Add non-Steam games

### Planned ðŸ“‹

- ðŸ“‹ Add support for manual config files via environment variable `BIPOPS_MANUAL_CONFIG=true`
- ðŸ“‹ CLI: create a `bip-ops` cli to handle admin tasks:
  - backups: list available backups
  - restore: restore from a backup
